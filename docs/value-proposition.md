## The problem

Currently there is a vast sea of distractions that can be more or less valuable and mentally engaging for modern internet users. 

In this ocean of possibilities of options to pass a couple of minutes in their daily routine, it is challenging for most people to identify the choices that combine ease of access and engaging content, which does not make the user feel like they have wasted their time on "just another stupid game".

Often these games are expertly designed to capture our attention, but leave us feeling like we are not actively straining our mental capacities. Rather they feel like they suppress our thoughts and worsen our ability to concentrate.

Most solutions to this problems also require an unwanted sign-up process that first has to be completed for the user to get a full experience. This is most often the case when the user wants to compare his/her statistics in the application to that of other users such as friends or colleagues.

## Our solution

Gamedle offers people that are looking for a quick but engaging challenge a hub for a number of games (TBD) that combine accessibility, variety and difficulty. 

We offer the user a platform where he can compare himself conveniently with desired competitors without the need of a direct sign-up to our side.
